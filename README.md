# Cardiovascular-Disease-Prediction-using-Deep-Learning
This repository implements a deep learning approach for cardiovascular disease (CVD) prediction using Bidirectional LSTM (BDLSTM) combined with CatBoost classifier. The research demonstrates how AI can transform healthcare by providing rapid, precise, and cost-effective identification of heart problems.
