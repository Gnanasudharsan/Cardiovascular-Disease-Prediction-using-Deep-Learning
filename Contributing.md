## ü§ù How to Contribute

### Reporting Bugs

1. **Check existing issues** first to avoid duplicates
2. **Use a clear title** that describes the bug
3. **Provide detailed information**:
   - Operating system and version
   - Python version
   - Library versions
   - Steps to reproduce
   - Expected vs actual behavior
   - Error messages or logs

### Suggesting Enhancements

1. **Check if the enhancement is already suggested**
2. **Provide a clear title** and detailed description
3. **Explain why this enhancement would be useful**
4. **Consider implementation details** if possible

### Code Contributions

#### Setup Development Environment

1. Fork the repository
2. Clone your fork:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/cardiovascular-disease-prediction.git
   cd cardiovascular-disease-prediction
   ```

3. Create a virtual environment:
   ```bash
   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
   ```

4. Install development dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   pip install -e .
   ```

#### Making Changes

1. **Create a new branch** for your feature:
   ```bash
   git checkout -b feature/your-feature-name
   ```

2. **Make your changes** following the coding standards below

3. **Add tests** for new functionality

4. **Run tests** to ensure everything works:
   ```bash
   pytest tests/ -v
   ```

5. **Update documentation** if needed

#### Coding Standards

- **Python Style**: Follow PEP 8 guidelines
- **Code Formatting**: Use `black` for automatic formatting:
  ```bash
  black src/ tests/ main.py
  ```
- **Linting**: Use `flake8` for linting:
  ```bash
  flake8 src/ tests/ main.py
  ```
- **Documentation**: Use docstrings for all functions and classes
- **Type Hints**: Add type hints where appropriate

#### Pull Request Process

1. **Update your branch** with the latest changes:
   ```bash
   git checkout main
   git pull upstream main
   git checkout your-feature-branch
   git rebase main
   ```

2. **Push your changes**:
   ```bash
   git push origin feature/your-feature-name
   ```

3. **Create a Pull Request** with:
   - Clear title and description
   - Reference to related issues
   - List of changes made
   - Screenshots if applicable

4. **Address review feedback** promptly

## üß™ Testing Guidelines

### Running Tests

```bash
# Run all tests
pytest

# Run with coverage
pytest --cov=src tests/

# Run specific test file
pytest tests/test_preprocessing.py

# Run with verbose output
pytest -v
```

### Writing Tests

- Place tests in the `tests/` directory
- Name test files with `test_` prefix
- Use descriptive test function names
- Test both normal and edge cases
- Mock external dependencies

Example test structure:
```python
def test_feature_selection_with_valid_data():
    """Test feature selection with valid input data."""
    # Arrange
    X, y = create_sample_data()
    selector = FeatureSelector(config)
    
    # Act
    X_selected = selector.fit_transform(X, y)
    
    # Assert
    assert X_selected.shape[1] < X.shape[1]
    assert len(selector.selected_features_) > 0
```
